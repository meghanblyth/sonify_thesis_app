The following artifact is a prototype iOS mobile software application developed using Swift and Python programming languages to facilitate the representation of visible light and imagery in the audible range. 

Please visit my [linkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/megblyth/) profile or [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC57V_O6tafB_O-_DRCWjNNQ) channel for a video tutorial of this application working. 

This software has been programmed in two programming languages and programming environments as follows:

# 1)	Image sonification process 

The image sonification process has been programmed in JythonMusic programming environment using Python programming language.  JythonMusic requires Python and Java to operate.  For this project, all necessary programming environments and dependencies were installed on a virtual machine using Azure.  

To replicate this, or test this application, you will require the free Jython Music download which can be found at https://jythonmusic.me/ 

Boiler plate code for the backend image sonification process was referenced from the Jython Music textbook "Making Music with Computers'. 


# 2)	Application development and the colour to sound sonification process 

This software application build, and the colour to sound sonification process, has been programmed in Swift programming language within the XCode environment.  All relevant folder and scripts can be found within the Sonify App folder.  

There is also an application icon and images folder which contains all artwork designed for the purposes of this project.  

The supplementary material video outlining the sonification process and user interface functionality during the use of this software application, as well as examples of trouble shooting issues which occurred during the testing process, can be found in this README.  


# REST API 

A REST API was used to send data to and from the backend Jython Music code on the virtual machine.  All API code is also included in this project.
